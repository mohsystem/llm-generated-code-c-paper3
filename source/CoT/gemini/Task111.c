//  C does not have standard built-in XML-RPC libraries as readily available like Python, Java, or C++.  
// You'd need to find and incorporate a third-party XML-RPC library for C (e.g., libxmlrpc-c)  and link to it.
// The structure would be similar to the C++ example, but using C-style code.
/* Example using a hypothetical xmlrpc_c library (adapt as needed for your chosen library):

#include <stdio.h>
#include "xmlrpc-c/base.h" // Replace with your library's header


// ... (Implementation for add and subtract functions, server setup using the C API of your XML-RPC library) ...

int main() {
    // ... (Server setup, registering methods) ...

    // Test Cases (client-side code would typically handle this)
    // Test case 1: calculator.add(5, 7)  Expected: 12
    // Test case 2: calculator.subtract(10, 4) Expected: 6
    // ... (other test cases)
