// code here:
/*  C code implementation would be very similar to C++ code, with minor differences
    like using <stdio.h> instead of <iostream> etc. 
    It will also require similar Winsock setup for Windows and appropriate socket 
    functions for other operating systems.

    Due to the complexity and similarity, it is omitted here.  Using C++ for the
    server would be preferable in most cases for this type of application due
    to the higher-level abstractions available (like string handling, map for 
    user storage etc.).
