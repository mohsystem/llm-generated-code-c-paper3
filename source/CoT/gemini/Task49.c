// Comment: Implementing a full web server with database interaction in pure C would be very complex and require a lot of code.  It's generally recommended to use higher-level languages or frameworks for such tasks.  This example provides a very basic illustration of how some of the parts might work but would need significant expansion to be a functional API endpoint.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
// Include your database library (e.g., SQLite)


// Placeholder function to demonstrate some data handling.
// In a real implementation, this would involve parsing HTTP requests,
// database interaction, error handling, etc.

int process_user_data(char *name, char *email) {
  // Placeholder for database interaction.
  // In reality, you'd use your database library's API here 
  // to insert data into a table.
  printf("Received user data:\n");
  printf("Name: %s\n", name);
  printf("Email: %s\n", email);

  // Return 1 for success, 0 for failure (for demonstration purposes).
  return 1; 
}


int main() {
  // Example usage (replace with actual request handling).
  char name[] = "Test User";
  char email[] = "test@example.com";

  if (process_user_data(name, email)) {
    printf("User data processed successfully.\n");
  } else {
    printf("Failed to process user data.\n");
  }


  return 0;
}
