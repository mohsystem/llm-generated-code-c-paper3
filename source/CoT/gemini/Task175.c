// The C version requires a similar MountainArray interface and implementation
// as provided in the C++ example.  The logic for findInMountainArray,
// findPeakIndex, and binarySearch would be largely the same.  However,
// handling dynamic arrays and passing MountainArray as a parameter would
// require careful memory management using malloc/free or a similar approach.

// Due to the complexities of implementing a fully functional and robust
// interactive solution in C within this limited scope, the C code is
// omitted here.  It's recommended to refer to the C++ implementation as
// a guide if you need to implement it in C.
