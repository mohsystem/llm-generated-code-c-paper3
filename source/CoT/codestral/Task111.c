// XML-RPC in C is not directly supported by the language.
// However, you can use libraries such as libxmlrpc or libxmlrpc++ to implement an XML-RPC server.
// This example does not include security measures. For a production environment,
// additional security measures such as authentication and encryption should be implemented.

// This is a placeholder. The actual code would depend on the chosen library.
