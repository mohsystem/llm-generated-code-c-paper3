/*
Due to the limitations of the C language and its standard library, there is no native support for SSL/TLS or IPv6. Generally, external libraries like OpenSSL or GnuTLS are used for such purposes, and IPv6 requires additional setup. Including such libraries would exceed the scope of this simple example. Thus, a complete C example is not feasible without additional dependencies.
