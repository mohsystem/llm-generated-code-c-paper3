// Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C is complex due to the lack of built-in data structures
// like hashmaps and priority queues.  A full implementation would require implementing these
// data structures, which is beyond the scope of a concise code example.  Therefore, this
// C example is omitted.  Please refer to the C++ implementation for a closer analogue.
