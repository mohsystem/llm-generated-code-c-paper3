//  C version implementation would be similar to C++ using sockets and multithreading.
//  However, serialization and some other conveniences from Boost would need to be 
//  implemented manually. It is more complex and less secure to manage memory 
//  and concurrency directly in C for this type of application. Therefore, 
//  providing a simplified illustrative example is more practical.  

/*
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
// ... (socket and threading includes - platform dependent)

// Simplified example (without robust networking or serialization):
int main() {
    // ... (socket setup and listening)

    while (1) {
        // ... (accept client connection)
        char command[256];
        recv(client_socket, command, sizeof(command), 0);

        // Basic command processing (insecure, no serialization, etc.)
        if (strncmp(command, "get ", 4) == 0) {
            // ... get object
        } else if (strncmp(command, "set ", 4) == 0) {
            // ... set object
        }

        // ... (close client connection)
    }

    return 0;
