//  C driver for MongoDB is less commonly used than C++ for complex interactions like CRUD operations with MongoDB.
//  Implementing a complete, secure CRUD example in C with the MongoDB driver would be significantly more complex 
//  than in C++. It requires handling BSON manually and managing memory meticulously, which increases the risk of
//  errors and security vulnerabilities if not handled expertly.  C++ provides higher-level abstractions (like the 
//  bsoncxx and mongocxx libraries) that simplify these tasks and improve safety.
