// C is not typically used for direct web applications
// Here's a comment explaining why:
// C is a low-level language and lacks built-in support for:
// 1. Web protocols
// 2. String manipulation
// 3. HTML generation
// 4. Security features needed for web applications
// Consider using a web-focused language/framework instead.
