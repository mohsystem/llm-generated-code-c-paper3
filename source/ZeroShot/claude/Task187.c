// C doesn't have built-in thread support.
// For threading in C, you would need to use platform-specific threading libraries
// like pthreads on UNIX systems or Windows threads on Windows.
// The implementation would be significantly more complex and less portable.
// Consider using C++ or another language with built-in thread support instead.
