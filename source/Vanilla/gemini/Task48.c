//  Implementation for C is similar to C++, using Winsock2 for networking.
//  Refer to the C++ implementation above. Adapting it to C would involve
//  managing client sockets in a dynamically allocated array and using
//  pthreads for handling multiple clients. Due to length restrictions,
//  the full C implementation is not provided here, but the C++ code
//  can be used as a guide for the C adaptation.
