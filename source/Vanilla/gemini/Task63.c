//  C does not have built-in support for base64 decoding or JSON parsing.

/*
Implementation in C would require including external libraries for Base64 decoding and JSON parsing (e.g., a combination of OpenSSL and cJSON). The code would involve similar steps as in C++, managing memory allocation carefully.  Due to the added complexity and length this would add to the combined code output, it's omitted here.
