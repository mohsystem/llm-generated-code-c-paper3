// Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in C is significantly more complex 
// than in languages with built-in hash maps and priority queues.  
// It would require custom implementations of these data structures, 
// which is beyond the scope of a concise code example.

// For a simplified demonstration, this C example only handles a fixed-size graph
// and uses a less efficient array-based approach.  A robust implementation
// would need dynamic memory allocation and more sophisticated data structures.


// Comment:  Full implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C with dynamic data structures
// is omitted for brevity.  See other language examples for a more complete solution.
