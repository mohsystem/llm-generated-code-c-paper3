// C implementation requires a bit more manual work for heaps

// Implement a basic min/max heap solution here if needed.  For brevity, it's omitted in this example
// but the C++ example shows the general structure using std::priority_queue which would need to be 
// replicated in C using a heap implementation.


/* Example usage (replace with actual implementation if you choose to implement the heaps in C):
int main() {
    // Example usage (Not functional without heap implementation)
    
    return 0;
}
